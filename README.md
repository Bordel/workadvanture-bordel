# Virtual 2D Bordel in WorkAdventure 

Inspired by [rC3](https://howto.rc3.world/), we decided to create a virtual representation of Bordel Hackerspace in [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re).

Virtual Bordel can serve for meeting members without being physically in Prague, hosting online events and parties. It cointains few hidden easter eggs and memes, find them all and have fun in our online chillzone! 

You can enter [WorkAdventure Bordel space here](https://play.workadventu.re/_/global/bordel.github.io/workadvanture-bordel/map.json).
Hosting own WorkAdventure instance is opened to discussion.
